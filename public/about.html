<h1>A little bit about me</h1>

<p>
  My name is McKenzie Sandefur, and I graduated from University of Houston in 2020<br />
  with a bachelors degree in Media Production. I currently work at the First Presbyterian<br />
  Church of Houston on the Media team by helping out with live sermons, setting up<br />
  classes, helping out with weekday events, and controlling the broadcast graphics<br />
  for live sermons.
</p>

<p>
  I've been working in this field for nearly 4 years now, and I love what I do, but I feel<br />
  as if I could do even more. I wanted to learn how to code and develop websites.<br />
  While I may not be a pro at it, I aim to be better everyday and learn something new<br />
  to enhance my skills and become a better person while I'm at it.
</p>

<p>
  Some technical skills that I have learned a long the way are: Final Cut Pro X,<br />
  Adobe Premiere Pro, Canva, Visual Studio Code, After Effects and HTML.

  Thank you for taking the time in reading this section. I hope that you're as<br />
  excited as I am to grow even more in the world of Web Development!
